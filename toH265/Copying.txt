/*  FlexibleMessageBox – A flexible replacement for the .NET MessageBox
* 
*  Author:         Jörg Reichert (public@jreichert.de)
*  Contributors:   Thanks to: David Hall, Roink
*  Version:        1.3
*  Published at:   http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/601900/FlexibleMessageBox
*  
************************************************************************************************************
* Features:
*  - It can be simply used instead of MessageBox since all important static "Show"-Functions are supported
*  - It is small, only one source file, which could be added easily to each solution 
*  - It can be resized and the content is correctly word-wrapped
*  - It tries to auto-size the width to show the longest text row
*  - It never exceeds the current desktop working area
*  - It displays a vertical scrollbar when needed
*  - It does support hyperlinks in text
* 
*  Because the interface is identical to MessageBox, you can add this single source file to your project 
*  and use the FlexibleMessageBox almost everywhere you use a standard MessageBox. 
*  The goal was NOT to produce as many features as possible but to provide a simple replacement to fit my 
*  own needs. Feel free to add additional features on your own, but please left my credits in this class.
